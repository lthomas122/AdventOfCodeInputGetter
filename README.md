**Instructions**
To obtain your session cookie, visit the puzzle input page. Right-click > Inspect, Open the Network tab and then hit Refresh (cmd/ctrl + R). Make sure All is selected in the sub tabs and once the page has reloaded you should see an asset called `input`. Click on it and another section of tabs will open. It should open with the first tab `Headers` selected, if it doesn't just select `Headers` from the tab options. Scroll down and find `cookie` under Request Headers, right-click on the value and select `Copy value`. You can paste that into `sessionCookie` at the top of `main.py`.
